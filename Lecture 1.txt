Procedural Programming (POP) -:                                                           
 *Derived from structural programming                                                    
 * A program is divided into small parts              
  called functions.
 * Procedural programming follows top down
   approach 
 *Function is more important than data.
 * Based on unreal world.
 * No proper way for hiding data, so it is 
  less secure.
 * Adding new data and function is not easy.
* Example: C, FORTAN, Pascal etc.
 

Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) -:
 *OOPs is based on real world.
 * Program is divided into small parts called objects.
 * Object oriented programming follows bottom up approach.
* Data is given more importance than functions,
 *Data hiding is possible and hence more secure.
 * Adding new data and functions is much easier.
 * Example: C++, Java, Python, C# etc.

Objects and Classes in JAVA...............................................................
 
 Objects --->
    -Anything that has a state and behaviour is known object e.g. chair, bike, pen, table etc.
    - They store data in form of variable and are a real world entity and operate using methods/functions.
    - It is an instance of class.

  Classes --->
    - A class is a group of objects which have common properties.
    - A class can be seen as a blueprint from which objects are created.
    - It can contain :
          -> Fields
          -> Methods
          -> Constructors
          -> Nested class and interface
          -> Blocks
